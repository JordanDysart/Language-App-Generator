# Asset Importer

I don't really want to rewrite code that doesn't need to be rewritten, so I started this project. The first milestone would be to "repository/data stream" java files and rename audio files so they are valid for android compilation.

End goal of the project would be to get it online, and reading directory from the android libraries that I'm trying to build.


### Import the important files

Notes: 

1. in reference to test_remove_symbol, why can't I get strip() to work inside a list comprehension?
